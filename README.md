## What is Open?
Open, also known as *The Open Video Hosting Project*, is an entirely handwritten website template, designed for those wanting to make their own YouTube alternative or (using API keys) clone. The name *Open* is sort of a pun on it being open-source. Currently, it is only in *Alpha*, meaning some features aren't complete yet, but you may feel free to contribute to the Open Project if you want to, see TODO.MD for what needs to be done.

## How to Get Open Running:
More detailed information about hosting your own Open based site can be found in `HOSTING.md`, but to simplify it, all you need is a server computer, a website hosting platform (like Apache2), any SQL Database, and some PHP and SQL knowledge and your set for life with your little Open site. By default, Open uses MySQL for its default SQL database, if you're going to use another SQL database service, you might need to change some of the PHP files.

## Common Questions
### Can I use Open with more modern tools (i.e. NodeJS or React)
Yes, but you'll obviously need to change the files.
### Does Open have its own ToS?
Not really, there are some more common rules you and your userbase must follow described in `RULES.md`, but you can pretty much make your own rules regarding mature or adult content in your Open site.
### How can I contribute to Open?
You can contribute to Open as long as you have a basic understanding of the PHP language. See `TODO.md` to what needs to be done.
### Why does Open look so... old?
The early web-esque look of Open was intentionally done since Open's UI/UX is based/inspired by early YouTube. You can give your fork a more modern feel if you want.
