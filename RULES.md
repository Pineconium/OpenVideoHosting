# Rules regarding hosting your own Open site.
These are rules all users of Open *must* follow when hosting their own site. Failure to do so would only cause problems for your site.
## 1. Making the Terms of Service.
### 1.1. Making your own rules.
You are allowed to have your own rules regarding what many people would deem as 'inappropriate content', this includes stuff such as violence, adult humour, sexual content, nudity, profanity, and mature topics.
Depending on what content you want on the site, you can choose how strict you want these rules to be. For sites aimed at a general/mixed audience (typically over 13s), you may choose to prevent pornographic content or excessive/real gore on the site.
### 1.2. Enforcing those rules.
Make sure your site has enough moderators to help enforce those rules chosen by you. Try to make sure any moderator(s) doesn't abuse the moderator role given by you; if they do, revoke the offender's role. 
You must also choose appropriate punishments for the users if they are caught breaking your rules. First-time offenders should only be given minimal punishments (unless it is something serious), such as a 1-hour 'timeout'.
## 2. Open's own rules.
### 2.1. Bot Accounts.
Try to prevent as many bot accounts as possible from your site, such as making/installing anti-bot plugins, enforcing stricter Captchas, etc. Failing to do so may result in your site having a 'bot-epidemic', which may cause server issues and loss of your user base.
### 2.2. Do not allow illegal content!
Hosters should not use Open to allow users to host what is deemed as 'illegal content', this includes, but is not limited to, any form of child pornography (sexualised content involving anyone under 18 regardless of what your local laws say), realistic and/or brutal child abuse,
threats of any form of terrorism (i.e. bomb threats), or anything regarding rape or life-threatening fetish content. If a user posts anything that would be deemed 'illegal content', immediately permaban or IP-ban the offender, remove the video from the server's storage, and contact the proper authorities. Sites that fail to follow this rule could potentially have their site seized by federal authorities.
### 2.3. AI-generated content.
Sites are allowed to host AI-generated content, albeit with some guidelines. AI-generated content must NOT be pushed out more than human-made content within the site, and any video(s) using AI-generated content should ONLY be used for "experimenting with" and not for engagement farming. Accounts that only upload AI-generated content for the sole purpose of getting views, likes, or any other form of engagement should either be banned or 'shadowbanned', depending on what *your* rules regarding AI-generated content are.
### 2.4. On-site Ads/Funding
Sites are allowed to have ads on their site since this is primarily for server costs, but make sure whatever ad engine you are using is properly moderated and has some form of quality control. Make sure that your site allows users with any ad blockers to access the site. You may choose to tell them that "ads help keep the website running", but don't deny them access to any part of the site if a user is using an ad-blocker.

You must also not be too needy about how your site gets server funds. Asking for donations is okay, but they should not sound like you're forcing someone to donate to your site. You also shouldn't add a 'minimum fund' system to your donation system, or at the very least keep it very small (under US$5.00). We also recommend starting a funding campaign for your Open-based site, especially considering that hosting sites like this can be expensive.
